# Google-Cloud-VM-for-ML
A comprehensive guide on how to set up from scratch a Google Cloud VM able to runs a Jupyter Notebook with Keras on TensorFlow, and with a large dataset available. 

As Google Cloud can be a bit hard to begin with, i hope this guide will help to to get where you want quickly and painlessly. 

## Goal: 

At the end of the document, we'll get a superpowerfull Virtual Machine running Ubuntu 18.04 on Google Cloud. 
This VM will be able:  
  -  to execute Python with Machine Learning library such as Tensorflow and Keras. 
  -  to launch and execute a Jupyter Notebook.
  -  to acces a huge database stored onto Google Cloud.
